          <h2>STABILIZER</h2>
          <p>The Stabilizer (Anti-Roll) Subsystem, commonly known as the sway bar or anti-roll bar, is a key part of a vehicle’s suspension system. It helps reduce body roll during cornering and enhances stability and handling by distributing force between the wheels.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="brand">
            <a href="engine/parts.html"><img src="picture/engine parts.png"  alt=""></a> 
          <h2>SUSPENSION GEOMETRY AND ALIGNMENT</h2>
          <p>The Suspension Geometry & Alignment Subsystem is crucial for ensuring stability, handling, tire wear, and overall driving performance. It refers to how suspension components (control arms, steering links, shock absorbers, etc.) are arranged and how they affect wheel alignment, weight distribution, and steering response.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="brand">
            <a href="engine/parts.html"><img src="picture/engine parts.png"  alt=""></a> 
          <h2>ADAPTIVE AND ACTIVE SUSPENSION</h2>
          <p>Modern vehicles use Adaptive & Active Suspension Systems to improve ride comfort, handling, and stability by dynamically adjusting suspension settings based on road conditions, driving style, and vehicle load. These advanced systems replace or enhance traditional passive suspensions with real-time electronic control.</p>
